## Introduction

Clients wants to create a Road Accident Dashboard for the year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the below.

## Primary KPI

1. Total Casualties taken place after the accident

2. Total Casualties and Percentage of total with respect to accident Severity and maximum casualties by type of road

## Secondary KPI

1. Total casualties with respect to vehicle type

2. Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year

3. Maximum Casualties by Road type

4. Distribution of total Casualties by Road surface

5. Relation between Casualties aby area/location and by day/Night

## Concepts Demonstrated

I used only Excel for this analysis in a bid to discover more dashboard tricks.

## Conclusion

1.	Total casualties in both years taken place after the accident is discovered to be 417,883

2.	Total casualties and Percentage of total with respect to severity and maximum casualties by type of road were discovered to be the following

-	Fatal Casualties – 7,135 and 1.7% of the total
-	Serious Casualties – 59,312 and 14.2% of the total
-	Slight Casualties – 351,436 and 84.1% of the total

3.	Total Casualties by vehicle type were discovered to be the following:
-	Casualties by Cars – 333,485
-	Casualties by Vans – 33,472
-	Casualties by bus – 12,798
-	Casualties by bike – 33,672
-	Casualties by agricultural vehicles – 1,032
-	Others – 3,424

4.	Monthly trend showing casualties in respect to year shows a general drop in casualties in 2022 from 2021. However, both years casualties peak at November.

5.	Casualties by road type shows a single carriageways have the highest number of casualties with over 309 thousand. The second highest is the dual carriageway with over 67 thousand.

6.	Distribution of casualties by road surface shows the following:

-	Dry Roads – 279,445
-	Wet – 115,261
-	Snow/Ice – 22,781

7.	Relation between casualties by area/Location shows more casualties in Urban than local areas. Urban areas with over 225 thousand casualties while rural area with 162 thousand.

8.	Relation between casualties by Light condition shows more casualties in daylight than dark conditions.

## Recommendations

1.	The analysis shows some surprising results. For instance, one would expect more casualties to occur when the road condition is wet or snowy than when dry. It is also expected that more casualties will occur when the roads are dark than during daylight. But this is most likely the result of drivers being more careful in worse conditions. The authorities need to do more in enforcing speed limits especially in good conditions.

2.	Speed limit should be enforced at single carriageways as they have by far the highest number of casualties. Authorities can also do more to make single carriageways dual carriageways.

3.	Casualties peak in November which might be a result of more traveling for the festive December period. Authorities should incentivise the use of buses (which have lower casualties than cars) in order to reduce the number of cars on the highway.
